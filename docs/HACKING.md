## Hacking BehTavan

Every project is hackable. Some projects are more. Here are some instructions on hacking the project, for the mentioned purposes.

### Adding New Power Function

1.  Add your function prototype to `include/power.hpp`, inside `BehTavan` namespace. Your function must follow the same prototype as others.

    Then, add your function information at the end of list of `getAllPowerFunctionsInfo()`'s return value.

1.  Implement your function in `src/power.cpp`.

1.  Recompile and run. You should now see your new function in the results.

### Working with Other Operations?

TBD.
